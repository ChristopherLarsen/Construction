### **TOTAL CORE TECH STACK: $1,021/month**

---

### Payment Processing: Stripe Fees

**Stripe Fees: $58,680/month** (assuming 3.4% average + $0.30 per transaction)

**Calculation:**
- 100 contracts × $15,000 average = $1,500,000/month
- 3.4% commission + $0.30 per transaction
- ($1,500,000 × 0.034) + (100 × $0.30) = $51,000 + $30 = **$51,030**
- Stripe Connect marketplace fee: +0.5% = $7,500
- **Total: ~$58,680/month**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: Stripe is a Pass-Through Cost

**Important:** Stripe fees are NOT a burden on platform profitability:
- ✅ These costs are **paid by clients**, not the platform
- ✅ Added on top of the tradesman's quote
- ✅ Client sees total cost = Tradesman Quote + Platform Commission + Stripe Fees
- ✅ Platform passes Stripe fees through to clients automatically
- ✅ Zero impact on platform margins

---

### Platform Economics

#### Revenue Model (100 Contracts/Month)

With 100 completed contracts at ~$15,000 average value:

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- Contracts with 20% commission (non-member): 50 × $15,000 × 20% = $150,000
- Contracts with 10% commission (member): 50 × $15,000 × 10% = $75,000
- **Total Monthly Commission Revenue: $225,000**

#### Unit Economics ✨

**Cost Per Contract:**
- Platform cost per contract: $1,021 ÷ 100 = **$10.21**

**Cost Per User Session:**
- Platform cost per session: $1,021 ÷ 10,000 = **$0.10**

**Tech as % of Revenue:**
- Tech cost vs. Commission revenue: $1,021 ÷ $225,000 = **0.45%**
- **This is excellent unit economics!**

---

### Scaling Projection (500 Contracts/Month)

As platform grows to 500 completed contracts per month:

**Revenue (at 500 contracts/month):**
- 250 × $15,000 × 20% = $750,000 (non-members)
- 250 × $15,000 × 10% = $375,000 (members)
- **Total: $1,125,000/month**

**Core Tech Stack (500 contracts/month):**
- Infrastructure scales to: $2,116/month (about 2x current)
- Still only **0.94% of revenue**

**Key Insight:** Infrastructure scales efficiently with volume

---

### Key Cost Optimizations Available

- **AWS Reserved Instances:** Save 30-40% ($210/month)
- **S3 Lifecycle policies** for old images: More aggressive archiving
- **More aggressive CDN caching:** Reduce origin requests
- **Email over SMS where possible:** Use SMS only for 2FA
- **Stripe volume discounts:** Negotiate rates at scale
- **AI Estimate optimization:** Batch processing, caching, efficient prompting

---

### Bottom Line: Excellent Unit Economics ✨

The tech stack is **very cost-efficient**, leaving plenty of margin for:
- ✅ Marketing and customer acquisition
- ✅ Operations and team expansion
- ✅ Legal and compliance
- ✅ Healthy profit margin (30-40% possible)

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Core tech cost: Only 0.45% of revenue** at launch
2. **Scales to 0.94% at 500 contracts/month** ✅
3. **Stripe fees are client costs**, not platform burden
4. **$225,000/month commission revenue** with only $1,021 in platform costs
5. **Platform is inherently profitable** from month 1 at scale

This demonstrates a **highly viable, capital-efficient business model** with strong unit economics and attractive margins.
