## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**Primary Revenue Model:**

**Who Pays:** Clients pay for all services. Tradesmen receive their full quoted amount; the commission is added on top and paid by the client.

1. **Transaction Commissions (Charged to Client)**
   - **Standard Rate:** 20% commission on every completed job
   - **Member Rate:** 10% commission for jobs completed by member tradesmen
   - Commission is added to the tradesman's quote and clearly displayed to clients
   - Revenue scales with platform activity

2. **Tradesman Membership Program**
   - **Free Tier (Non-Members):**
     - Complete ONE job for free (trial period)
     - Access to basic platform features
     - Standard profile listing
     - Ability to submit quotes on available jobs
     - Jobs completed by non-members incur 20% client commission
   - **Paid Monthly Membership ($50/month):**

     - Priority listing in search results
     - Enhanced profile with portfolio showcase

## Core Capabilities

### 1. AI-Powered Cost Estimation

- This is the hard part, training an AI to estimate better than a human

**Value Proposition:**
- Clients receive instant cost estimates before contacting contractors
- Provides realistic budget expectations
- Reduces time wasted on projects outside budget
- Creates baseline for comparing tradesman quotes

**Important Clarification: AI Estimate vs. Tradesman Quote**

The AI estimate is a **non-binding guideline** designed to:
- Give clients realistic budget expectations
- Help tradesmen understand the project scope and price range
- Serve as a reference point for quote comparison

**The tradesman's quote is the official, binding estimate for the job.** Once a client accepts a tradesman's quote, that becomes the contracted price (subject to change order provisions).

**Process:**
1. Client describes project through text, voice, or form
2. Client uploads images of work area
3. System analyzes project scope using AI
4. AI generates cost range with breakdown (2-5 minutes)
5. Client can proceed to request tradesman quotes or adjust project scope

**Client Benefits:**
- Immediate budget guidance
- No obligation to hire
- Anonymous until ready to engage
- Educational tool for understanding costs

### 2. Not-to-Exceed Budget Protection

Clients can set a **maximum budget** (not-to-exceed amount) when posting their project:

**How It Works:**
- Client specifies the maximum they're willing to spend
- This amount is visible to tradesmen when browsing jobs
- Tradesmen can choose whether to bid based on the budget
- All quotes must come in at or below the not-to-exceed amount

**Unrealistic Budget Warning:**
If the AI determines that a client's not-to-exceed budget is **unreasonably low** for the scope of work requested:
- The system will display a warning to the client
- Message: "Based on our analysis, your maximum budget of $X is likely too low for this project scope. It's unlikely tradesmen will submit quotes at this price point."
- Client can choose to:
  - Adjust budget upward
  - Reduce project scope
  - Proceed anyway (understanding they may receive no bids)

**No-Bid Situations:**
- If no tradesmen submit quotes within the budget, the client is notified
- Platform suggests adjusting budget or scope
- No charge to the client for unmatched projects

### 3. Tradesman Marketplace

**Value Proposition:**
- Pre-qualified leads with budget expectations
- Access to AI estimates helps competitive pricing
- Verified client information
- Streamlined quote submission process

**For Tradesmen:**
- Browse jobs by specialty, location, and budget
- See AI estimate as pricing reference
- Submit detailed quotes with timeline
- Track quote status and win rate
- Build reputation through ratings

**For Clients:**
- Receive multiple quotes for comparison
- View tradesman credentials and ratings
- Direct communication with interested contractors
- Transparent pricing and timeline estimates

### 4. Multi-Project Management

**Client Benefits:**
- Manage multiple renovation projects simultaneously
- Track different contractors for different jobs
- Compare estimates and quotes across projects
- Maintain organized project history
- Easy access to project documentation

**Project States:**
- **Draft:** Initial planning, not yet submitted
- **Estimating:** AI processing cost estimate
- **Estimated:** AI estimate complete, ready to post
- **Posted:** Open for tradesman quotes
- **In Progress:** Job awarded, work underway
- **Completed:** Project finished and paid
- **Archived:** Historical reference

### 5. Contract Generation & Management

**Time & Materials:**

**"Not to Exceed" Protection:**

Every contract includes a maximum price cap that the contractor cannot exceed without written authorization:

*Example Language:*
> "The total cost for all work described in this contract, including any authorized change orders, shall not exceed $[AMOUNT] without prior written approval from the client. If the contractor anticipates costs approaching this limit, they must notify the client in writing when costs reach 90% of this maximum."

- Connects clients with independent contractors
- Provides AI-powered estimation tools
- Facilitates communication and payment processing
- Does NOT perform construction work
- Does NOT act as agent for clients or contractors

#### AI Estimate Disclaimers & Liability Limitations

**Critical Legal Protection:**

All AI-generated estimates must include clear, prominent disclaimers:

**Standard Disclaimer Language (Draft):**
> "This AI-generated estimate is provided for informational and planning purposes only. It is NOT a binding quote, contract, or guarantee of actual costs. Actual project costs may vary significantly based on site conditions, material availability, labor rates, unforeseen complications, and other factors. This estimate does not constitute professional advice. Always obtain detailed written quotes from licensed contractors before proceeding with any construction project. Construction Connect Canada makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of this estimate."

**Placement Requirements:**
- Displayed prominently before estimate is generated

## Cost Analysis

### Summary: Tech Stack Costs

**Assumptions:**
- 10,000 user sessions per month
- 100 completed contracts per month
- ~$15,000 average contract value

### Monthly Costs Breakdown

#### AWS Infrastructure: $525/month

| Service | Cost | Details |
|---------|------|---------|
| EC2 Instances | $250 | 2-10 t3.medium instances (auto-scaled) |
| RDS PostgreSQL | $150 | db.t3.medium Multi-AZ with 100GB SSD |
| ElastiCache Redis | $75 | cache.t3.small (2 nodes for HA) |
| S3 Storage | $23 | 1GB/day of images/documents (~30GB/month) |
| CloudFront CDN | $15 | Global content delivery |
| **Subtotal** | **$525** | |

#### Core Services (DocuSign, AI, Maps, SMS/Email): $150/month

| **Subtotal** | **$300** | |

### **TOTAL CORE TECH STACK: $1,021/month**

---

### Payment Processing: Stripe Fees

**Stripe Fees: $58,680/month** (assuming 3.4% average + $0.30 per transaction)

**Calculation:**
- 100 contracts × $15,000 average = $1,500,000/month
- 3.4% commission + $0.30 per transaction
- ($1,500,000 × 0.034) + (100 × $0.30) = $51,000 + $30 = **$51,030**
- Stripe Connect marketplace fee: +0.5% = $7,500
- **Total: ~$58,680/month**

### ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: Stripe is a Pass-Through Cost

**Important:** Stripe fees are NOT a burden on platform profitability:
- ✅ These costs are **paid by clients**, not the platform
- ✅ Added on top of the tradesman's quote
- ✅ Client sees total cost = Tradesman Quote + Platform Commission + Stripe Fees
- ✅ Platform passes Stripe fees through to clients automatically
- ✅ Zero impact on platform margins

**Example:**
- Tradesman quote: $10,000
- Platform commission (10-20%): $1,000 - $2,000
- Stripe processing fee (~3.4%): $340
- **Client pays: $11,340 - $12,340**
- **Platform keeps: Commission only ($1,000 - $2,000)**

---

### Platform Economics

#### Revenue Model (100 Contracts/Month)

With 100 completed contracts at ~$15,000 average value:

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- Contracts with 20% commission (non-member): 50 × $15,000 × 20% = $150,000
- Contracts with 10% commission (member): 50 × $15,000 × 10% = $75,000
- **Total Monthly Commission Revenue: $225,000**

Note: This assumes 50% of tradesmen are paid members ($50/month) and 50% are non-members

#### Cost Structure

**Monthly Costs:**
- Core Tech Stack: $1,021
- Stripe Fees (pass-through): $58,680 (paid by clients, not platform)
- Support & Operations: $300
- Legal & Compliance: ~$1,667 (amortized from $20K/year)
- **Total Platform Operating Costs: $3,288**

#### Unit Economics ✨

**Cost Per Contract:**
- Platform cost per contract: $3,288 ÷ 100 = **$32.88**
- Stripe fee per contract (from client): ~$587 (pass-through)
- **Platform's true cost per contract: $32.88**

**Cost Per User Session:**
- Platform cost per session: $3,288 ÷ 10,000 = **$0.33**

**Tech as % of Revenue:**
- Tech cost vs. Commission revenue: $3,288 ÷ $225,000 = **1.46%**
- **This is excellent unit economics! 🎉**

---

### Scaling Projection (500 Contracts/Month)

As platform grows to 500 completed contracts per month:

**Revenue (at 500 contracts/month):**
- 250 × $15,000 × 20% = $750,000 (non-members)
- 250 × $15,000 × 10% = $375,000 (members)
- **Total: $1,125,000/month**

**Cost Scaling (500 contracts/month):**
- Infrastructure: $1,200 (scales modestly)
- Core Services: $250 (volume discounts)
- Monitoring: $50 (same)
- Support & Operations: $1,500 (2 full-time reps)
- Legal & Compliance: $2,500 (more complex, more provinces)
- **Total Operating Costs: $5,500/month**

**Unit Economics at Scale:**
- Cost per contract: $5,500 ÷ 500 = **$11/contract** ✅
- Cost per session: $5,500 ÷ 50,000 = **$0.11/session** ✅
- Tech as % of revenue: $5,500 ÷ $1,125,000 = **0.49%** 🚀

**Key Insight:** Even at 5x scale, platform costs are only **0.49% of revenue**
